The so.py script parses a stack overflow data dump and determines
each user's Jon Skeet number. 

The Jon Skeet number is the Erdos Number of Stack Overflow. The Erdos Number
is based on authorship of papers. To calculate a Jon Skeet number
I define the "authorship" of answers. First, only questions that are not closed
and not community wiki are considered. A question must also have an answer of
at least 5 upvotes (doesn't matter if there is an accepted answer or not). The
"authors" that answered that question are determined as follows. Say the top
answer has X points. All users with an answer in the range [ceil(0.75*X), X]
are considered authors.
